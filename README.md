For some reason, I lost everything in this project. Maybe I forgot to push? I don't know...
Anyhow, the point is, it's not on git nor on my disk. So... I'm kinda desperate as i've worked really hard on this
and it is kind of necessary for the client version to work. 

The exe is still available for download for those interested but be aware that no update of any kind
will be distributed...
